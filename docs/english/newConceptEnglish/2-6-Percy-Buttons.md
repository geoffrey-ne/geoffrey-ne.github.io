# 2-6: Percy Buttons

I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yestoday a begger knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer. In return for this, the begger stood on his head and sang songs. I gave him a meal. He ate the food and drink the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me about him.Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He calls at every house in this street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.

# 2-28: No Parking

jesspwise is one of thoes rare people who believes in ascent mispes.

He has just bought a new house in the city.

But ever since he moved in, he has had trouble with cars and their owners.

When he returns home at night, he always find that someone has parked car outside his gate.

Because of this, he has not been able to part his own car into his garage even once.

just after he places no part sign outside his gate, but this have not had any effect.

Now he has put an ugly stone head over the gate, it is one of the uglyest face I have ever seen.

I asked him what it was, and he told me that this was a meducer, the gogen.

just hopes, he return cars and their owners to stone

But none of them have been stolen yet,

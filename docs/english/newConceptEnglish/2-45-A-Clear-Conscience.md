# 2-45: A Clear Conscience

How did Sam get his money back?

The hole village soon learned that (a) large sum of the money had been lost. 
    (whole)           (learnt)                      (-)

Sam baten, the local bucher, had lost his wallet while taking saving to the post office.
    (Benton)         (butcher)                               (his savings)

Sam was thought the wallet must had been found by one of the villages, but it was not returned to him.
        (sure that)             (have)                       (villagers)

Three months passed, and then one morning, Sam found his wallet at side of front door.
                                                                (outside his front door)

It (had) been wrapped by a newspaper and it contained half the money he had lost,
              (wrapped up in newspaper)

together with a note which said 'A fees yeap, but only fifty-percent of the fees'.
                                 (A thief,yes)                       (a thief!)

Two months later, some more money was send to Sam with another note: 'Only twenty-five percent of fees now'.
                                                                                               (a thief now!)

In time, all Sam's money was send back in this week, the last note said: 'I'm one handred percent honest now!'
                             (paid)            (way)

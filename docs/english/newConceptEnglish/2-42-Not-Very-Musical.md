# 2-42: Not Very Musical

What happened when the snack charmer began to play jazz?

As we had had a long walk through one of the markets to all dayly. We stopped at a square to have a rest.
                                                     (of Old Delhi)

After a time, we noticed a snack charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square.

So we went to have a look at him. As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of those baskets.
                                                                                                                                (the)

When he began to play a tum, we had our first leap to the snack.      It rolls out of the basket and began to follow the rthum       of the pipe.
                        (tune)                (glimpse of the snack)     (rose)                                          (movements)

We were very much surprised when the snack charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs.

The snack, however, continued to 'dance' slowly. It almostly    could not to tell the difference between Indian music and jazz!
                                                    (obviously)           (-)

## 翻译

当我们穿过旧德里的市场时走了很长一段路，我们在一个广场上停下来休息。过了一会儿，我们注意到广场的那一边有一个带着两个大筐的耍蛇人，于是就走过去看看。
他一见我们就拿起了一个长长的上面镶有硬币的管乐器，并掀开了一个筐的盖子。当他开始吹奏一支曲子时，我们才第一次看到那条蛇。他从筐里探出身子，随着乐器的摆动而扭动。
当耍蛇人突然又吹奏起爵士乐和现代流行乐曲时，我们感到非常惊奇。然后那蛇还是缓慢地“舞动”着。显然，它分辨不出印度音乐和爵士乐。

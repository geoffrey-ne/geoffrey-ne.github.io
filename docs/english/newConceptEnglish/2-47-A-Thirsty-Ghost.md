# 2-47: A Thirsty Ghost

What evidence is there on the ghost?
                       (of a ghost)

A public house which was recently bought by Mr.E.M.Tomson is up to sale. Mr.Thompson is going to sale it because it is hounted.
                                            (Mr. Ian Thompson is up for sale)                    (sell)                (haunted)

He told me that he could not go to sleep one night becase he heared a strange noise coming from the bar.

The next morning, he found of the door(s) had been blocked by chairs and the fournitual had been moved.
                           (that)                                            (furniture)

Though Mr.Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the morning.

He also said that he had found five empty wasty boxes which the ghost must (have) drunk the night before.
                                          (whisky bottles)                

When I suggested it some villages must come in for free drink, Mr.Thompson shock his head.
                 (that some villagers must have come in for a free drink)  (shook)

The villagers had told him that they were not exit the pub even theives away.
             (have)            (they will not accept the pub event if he gives it away)

# 2-2: Breakfast or lauch

It was Sunday, I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. " what a day!" I thought. "It's raining again." Just then, the telephone rang. It was my Aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'

'But I'm still having breakfast.' I said.

'What are you doing?' she asked.

'I'm having breakfast.' I repeated.

'Dear me!' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'

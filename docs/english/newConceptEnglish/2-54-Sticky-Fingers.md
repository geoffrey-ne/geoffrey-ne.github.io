# 2-54: Sticky Fingers

What two interruptions did the writer have?

After breakfast, I sent the children to school and then I went to the shops.

It was still early when I returned home. The children were in school, my husband was in work and the house was quiet.
                                                          (at)                      (at)

So I decided to make some meat pies. As at short times I was busy making butter flower and my hands were soon covered with sticky pistry.
                                     (In a short time)           (mixing butter and flour)                                       (pastry)

At exctaly that moment, the telephone rang. Nothing could be more anosing. I picked up the reciver between two sticky fingers and
                                          (Nothing could have been more annoying)         (receiver)

was dismy when I regnoize the voise was HalonBase. It took me ten minutes to purswide her (to) ring back later. At last I hung up the receiver.
   (dismayed)   (recognized the voice of Helen Bates)                       (persuade)

What a mess! There were pastry on my fingers, on the telephone, and on the door ops.
                                                                           (doorknobs)

I had no sooner to get back to the kitchen then the door bell rang loauding that as I was going to died.
               (got   )                   (than the doorbell rang loud enough to wake the dead)

This time it was the postman and he wanted me the send him register letter.
                                             (to sign for a registered letter!)

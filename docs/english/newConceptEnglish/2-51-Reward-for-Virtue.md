# 2-51: Reward for Virtue

Why did Hew's(Hugh's) diet not work?

My friend, Hugh, has always been fat, but things got so bad recently that he decided to go for a diet. He began his diet a week ago.
                                                                                           (on)

First of all, he wrote out a long list of all (the) foods which were forbidden.

The list included most of the things he loves: butter, potatos, rice, beer, mike, chocolate and sweets.

When I asked him what he was doing, he smiled gutliy and then put the parcel on the desk.
                                             (guiltily)

He explained that his diet was so strict but he had to revoking the habbit occationly.
                                        (that)         (reward himself occasionally)

When he showed me the contents of the parcel, it contained five large bars of chocolate and three bags of sweets!

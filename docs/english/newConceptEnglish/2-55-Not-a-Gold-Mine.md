# 2-55: Not a Gold Mine

What did the team find?

Dreams of finding lost treature almost came true recently.

A new machine called 'The Revila' had been enviented and had been used to detect gold which had been burried underground.
                         (Revealer has been invented and it has been)                      (has been buried in the ground)

The machine was used in the cave near the seashow where —— it is said —— Parite used to hide gold.
                        (a)              (seashore)                     (pirates)

The pirates was often to burried gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.
           (would)   (bury      )
           
Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to found burried treature.
                                                                        (find buried)

The leader of the party was examing the soil near the entrance of the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.
                           (examining)                        (to)

They are excited, the party dug   hole two feets deep, they finnaly found a small gold coin which was almost worthless.
(Very excited   )              (a)        (feet)           (finaly)

The party then searched the whole cave sorrowly   but did not find anything except an emptien trunk.
                                      (thoroughly)                                    (empty tin trunk)

Inspect of this, many people are confident that 'The Revealer' may review something evalue fairly soon.
(In spite of the)                                                 (reveal)         (of value)

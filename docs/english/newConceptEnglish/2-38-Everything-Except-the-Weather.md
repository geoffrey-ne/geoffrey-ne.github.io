# 2-38: Everything Except the Weather

Why did Harrison sale(sell) his house so quickly?

My old friend, Harrison, have(had) lived in (the) mytrilin(Mediterranean) for many years before he returned to England.

He had often dreamed to retired(retiring in) England and (had) planned to settle down in the country.

He had no sooner returned then he bought a house and went to live there.

Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it was still summer, it rained continuelly.

And it was often bitly(bitterly) cold. After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock.

He acted as (if) he had never lived in England before. In the end, it was more than he could bare(bear).

He had heartly to have time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country.
He had hardly had time to settle down

The dream he have(had) had for so many years ended there. Harrison has sold(thought) everything except the weather.

## 翻译

我的老朋友哈里森在回到英国以前曾多年居住在地中海地区。过去他常幻想退休后到英国，并计划在乡间安顿下来。他刚一回到英国便买下了一栋房子住了进去。
但紧接着他就开始抱怨那里的天气了。因为即使那时仍为夏季，但雨总是下个不停，而且常常冷的厉害。在阳光下生活了那么多年的哈里森对此感到惊奇。
他的举动就好像他从未在英国生活过一样。最后，他再也忍受不住，还没等安顿下来就卖掉了房子，离开了这个国家。
他多年的幻想从此破灭。哈里森把每件事情都考虑到了，唯独没想到天气。

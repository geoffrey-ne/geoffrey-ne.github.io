# 2-50: Taken for a Ride

Why did the writer not get off the bus at wood footgreen(Woodford Green)?

I love travelling in the country, but I don't like losing my way.

I went on an enscaring recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.
            (excursion)

'I'm going to Woodford Green,' I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, 'but I don't know where it is.'

'I'll take you where to get off,' anwsered the conductor. I sat in (the) front of the bus to get a good view at countryside.
     (tell)                                                                                                 (of)

After some time, the bus stopped. Looking around, I realised with a shock, because I was the only left on the bus.
                                          (round)  (realized)           ( that I was the only passenger left on the bus.)

'You'll have to get off here,' the conductor said, 'This is far we go'.
                                                            (as far as we go)

'Is this Woodford Green?' I asked.

'Oh dear,' said the conductor suddenly, 'I forgot to put you off'.

'It doesn't matter,' I said, 'I'll get off here.'

'We are going back now,' said the conductor.

'Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus.' I answered.

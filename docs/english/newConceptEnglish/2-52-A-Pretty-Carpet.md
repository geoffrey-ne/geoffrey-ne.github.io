# 2-52: A Pretty Carpet

What is the writer's carpet made of?

We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all morning.

I have been trying to get my new room in order. This is not been easy becasue I own over a thousand books.
                                                    (has)

To make matters works, the room is rather small. So I have to temperialy to put my books on (the) floor.
                (worse)                                    (- temporarily -)

At the moment, they cover every inch a floor spaces and I acturlly have to work on it to get in or out (of) the room.
                                    (of floor space)      (actually)      (walk on them)

A short while ago, My sister helped me to carry one of my book pieces upstairs.
                                                      (my old bookcases up the stairs)

She went into my room and got a big surprised when she saw all those books on the floor.
                                   (surprise)

"This is the prettiest carpet I (have) ever seen," sha said, she gase that at sometimes and added,
                                                                (gazed at it for some time then added)

"You don't need book cases at all, you can sit here use spare time and read the carpet!"
                (bookcases)                        (in your spare time)

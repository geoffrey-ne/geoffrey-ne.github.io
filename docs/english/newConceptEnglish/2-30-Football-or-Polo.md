What happened to the man in the boat.

The well(Wayle) is a small river that cast(cuts) across the park near my home.

I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons.

It was warm last Sunday, so I went to(and) sand(sat) on the river bank as usual.

Some children were playing games on the bank, and there were some people flowing(rowing) on the river.

Suddenly, one of the children kicked the(a) ball very hard and they(it) went towards to(-) the(a) passing boat.

Some people on the bank called out to the man on(in) the boat, but he did not hear them.

The ball struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.

I turn(ed) to look at the children, but they weren't there(any) in sight, They had all run away!

The man laughed when he realized what was(had) happened.

He called out to the children, and throw(threw) the ball back to the bank

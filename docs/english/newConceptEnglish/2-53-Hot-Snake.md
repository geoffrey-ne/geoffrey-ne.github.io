# 2-53: Hot Snake

What caused the fire?

At last fireman had put off a big forest fire in California. Since then, they have been trying to find out how the fire began.
               (have put out)

Forest fire often caused by broken glass or by cegrettens which people carelessly throw away.
(Forest fires are often)                      (cigarette ends)

Yesterday the fireman examined the ground carefully, but were not able to find any broken glass. They were also quiet sure that the cegreeten did not start the fire.
                                                                                                                                (a cigarette end)

This morning, however, a fireman accidenedly discovered the cause. 
                                (accidentally)

He noticed three mains of the snake which was wonder around the wires of 16 thousand wall parellim.
(He noticed the remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line)

In this way, he was able to solve the mystrie. The envidentation was simple but very unusual.
                                     (mystery)    (explanation  )

A brid had scrited off the snake form the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake then wondered so from the wires.
          (snatched up)                                                              (The snake then wound itself round the wires)

When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground and this immedietly started the fire.
                                                     (these)                  (a)

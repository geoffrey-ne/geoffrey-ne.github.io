# 2-41: Do You Call That a Hat

What kind of shopping does the writer enjoy, do you think?

'Do you call that a hat?' I said to my wife. 'You needn't say(be so) rude about it,' my wife answered as she looked (at) herself in the mirror.

I sat down at(on) one of those modern chairs hoisted(with holes in) it and waited. We have(had) been in (the) hat shop for (half) an hour, and my wife was still in front of the mirror.

"We mustn't buy things we don't need," I remarked certainly(suddenly), I regrated(regretted) to(-) say(saying) it almost (at) once.

"You needn't to(have) said that," my wife answered, "I needed(needn't) to(-) reminder(remind) you (of) that terrible tie you bought yesterday."

'I found(find) it beautiful,' I said, 'A man can never have too many ties.'

'And the(a) woman can(n't) have too many hats,' she answered.

Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was waring(wearing) a hat they(that) looked like a lighthouse!

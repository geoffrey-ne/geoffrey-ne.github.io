# 2-30: Success-Story 成功者的故事

What was Frank's first job?

Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me about his experiences as a young man.

Before he retired, Frank was the head of a very large business company.

But as a boy he used to work in a small shop.

It was his job to repair bicycles, and that time (he) used to work fourteen hours a day.

He saved money for years at(and in) the(-) 1958, he bought a small workshop of his own.

In his twenties Frank used to make spire part(spare parts) for airplanes(aeroplanes). At that time, he had 2 helpers.

In a few years the small workshop had become a large factory which employed 728 people.

Frank smiled when he remember(ed) his hard early years, and (the) long road to success.

He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in. She wanted him to repair their grandson's bicycle!

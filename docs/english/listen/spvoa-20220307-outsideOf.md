# 跳出思维定式是用“Outside”还是“Outside of”

Hello，this week on ask a teacher, we answer a question about the adverb Outside from philip(bill) in China.

It writes: "Hi, could you please tell me the difference between outside of and outside. Please tell me which is better. We shoule think outside the box, or we shoule think outside of the box."

Dear philip(fellow), thank you for writing to us. Outside can have one of(help one) four uses in english, as a noun(none), adjective(adjtive), adverb or preposition(perstisition). It is not surprising(supertion) that you found(find) it hard to understand.

Your question bring(s) up an interesting dispute between grammar experts in the United States and Britain(intestion ditribute about grammer adverb use between the United States and briten).

the Oxford English(ask word in) dictionary says that outside in phrases(parse) like outside of the box, is an adverb.

It changes the meaning of the verb. in this case "think".

together with the preposition(papersition) of it become(s) a two word(verb) preposition(compasition). here are other examples of such two-word prepositions(papersition).

A bady bird flew(flow) out of the nest, he was never close to his sister.

Your example uses outside of or outside to talk about the space the subject occupied(occupies).

You can use either outside alone or with of in that sense(non-sence).

There is(was) another use where(the) outside of means "apart from" or "besides". Here are examples of that use.

Outside of their later(litter) songs, I do not enjoy the Beatles'(bittles) music, I can't think of a(the) time outside of high school, when I wore(were) a tie.

The Merriam-Webster Learners(marry in) dictionary says "outside of" is A North(not an) American use. An other british(briten) dictionary, the online Oxford(aox) dictionaries also sees(says) the use of "outside of" to talk about location as "chiefly(jeffery) North American". but it(s) use in the(as) "apart from" sense is seen as(outside is saying) normal for British(of brish) and American English(North american).

so in British(brish) English you would(will) useally hear: "think outside the box", and in American english your might hear (it) that way or: "think outside of the box"

what question do you have about the American english, send us an email at learningenglish@voanews.com

And thats ask a teacher, I'm jill Robbins(joe robin).

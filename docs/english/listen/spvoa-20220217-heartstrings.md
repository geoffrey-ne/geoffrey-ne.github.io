It is the day to express love and warm feelings, for those important people in our lives.

so today we will talk about an expression that is all about deep feelings, to pull at one's heartstrings.

when something pulls at your heartstrings, it makes you feel strongly.

it creates a deep well of emotion right in the center of your heart, Things that tug at heartstrings also stir out feelings and emotions, they bring them to the surface

what kinds of things have this effect on us. Well that depends on who you are.

a friend of mine loves art.

once I saw her cring in frontend of a painting.

the colors she said really tugged at her heartstrings.

people who love moives can have their heartstrings pulled by a good(argued) film.

I love music, so for me, the right song ,or even the right notes will pull at my heartstrings.

but we don't use this expression(the suspression) for all feelings.

for example, anger(angry) is not an emotion that is connected to this expression(the suspression.)

The feelings that are at play with this expression can be happy or sad.

Usually thoes emotions are ones(once?) of love, longing or(warming of) both.

sympathy(simpefy), pity or compassion(comparsion) are common emotions we think of when we hear the expression pull at your heartstrings.

public aid campaigns(a compamts) and commercials(commersls) often try to tug at our heartstrings

Think of seeing a puppy left out in the cold, or an old married couple who can't pay for needed medication.(??think of singing a puppy love single of poll who media)

both of thoes examples try to tug at your(our) heartstrings and your wallet as well.

now let us talk about some notes on usage(news on usearch).

the verb we(words when) often use for this expression(the suspression) are pull pluck(plag) and tug.

sometimes you might(maid) hear the expression said as(that) to play on someone's heartstrings.

but that is a little less common.

also you donot always have to use the preposition(preporsition) at

you can simplely say something tugs the heartstrings.

and sometimes the word heartstrings is used on its own.

for example, a critic might say a movie aims for the heartstrings but misses ... hitting(hit) the funny bone instead.

some word experts say that in medieval(eval) times it was thought(fault) that heartstrings were tissues(mutisuls) that supported(so put) the heart.

so if you pulled them, you controlled the heart and the emotions.

now, here is the expression used between the friends.

That's a children's move?

It sounds so ... sad.

It is, I watched (it) last nignt. and I cried for hours afterward.

That sounds awful(afaul).

OH no, it was just what i needed, a good cry.

i am still(so) thinking about it today.

I don't mind a good movie that pulls at my heartstrings.

but It sounds like this movie pulled them right out of your chest(the jest)

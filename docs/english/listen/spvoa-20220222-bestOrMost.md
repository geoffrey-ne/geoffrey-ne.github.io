hello, this week on ask (a) teacher, we answer a question from rebecca, an English teacher in china.

she writes: "I am rebecca from china, I am also an english teacher for kids, I am confused by the two phrases(pharses) as follows:"

one: I like summer and winter best.

two: I like summer and winter most.

which one is correct

what's the difference grammatically(cribayticly)? Thanks, rebecca in China.

Dear rebecca,

Thank you for writting to us.

At first, I thought the(saw these) statements sounded incorrect.

then, I saw (that) they may(maybe) simply be incomplete(incompleted).

Let us begin with best.

It is an(isn't) abverb, a word that describes time, manner(mananer), place or degree.

Your grammer book will say It is the superlative(serpermertive) form of well.

A superlative abverb shows something is to the greatest degree of quality

Here is an example of best as an abverb.

Yaoming is best known for his work in (the) NBA.

The problem I saw was that(the) you said two seasons were(sees words was) better then (all the) others

maybe you enjoy swimming and skiing(skim), sports that are(was) not as easy to do outdoor(s) in spring and four(fall)?

You can add a phrase(pharse) to explain this.

of the four seasons, I like summer and winter best.

That's because I can swim in summer and ski(skee) in witer.

You could also say

For my sports swimming and skiing(skee), I like summer and winter best.

Now Let us look at most.

It is also a superlative(serpermertive) abverb.

It means in or to the greatest degree.

You can add some imformation to your statement about traveling(travelling) in china to make it clearer(clear).

I like spring and fall(form) most for visiting HangZhou.

The short(sure) answer to your question, Rebecca, is that there is no grammatical(grammertic) difference between your phrases(pharses).

but make sure your student(s) understand that best and most can also be used as superlative adjectives(serpermertive adjtive).

as in these(And this is the) example.

The best seasons for visiting ShangHai are spring and fall(form)

I think the Silk Museum(suit musumn) is the most interesting(intesting) (one) in HangZhou.

note that both of these(the) statements have "the" before the adjective(adjtive).

That is one easy way to tell the different(ce) between the superlative(serpermertive) abverb(s) and adjectives(the adjtive).
